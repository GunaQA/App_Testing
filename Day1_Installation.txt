 DAY1:
-------
1.Java Introduction
2.Class,Method,Object
3.Same package and Different package
4.Encapsulation

QUESTIONS(Theory):
------------
1.What is platform independent?

The meaning of platform-independent is that the java compiled code(byte code) can run on all operating systems. 
A program is written in a language that is a human-readable language. 
It may contain words, phrases, etc which the machine does not understand. ... 
This intermediate representation in Java is the Java Byte Code.
-----------------------------------------------
2.What is open source?

Open-source software is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, 
study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. 
Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner.
-------------------------------------------------
3.Difference between JDK,JRE,JVM?

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. 
It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. 
It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.
The JVM performs the following main tasks:

Loads code
Verifies code
Executes code
Provides runtime environment

JRE
JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. 
It is also written as Java RTE. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. 
It is used to provide the runtime environment. 
It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.

JDK
JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. 
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. 
It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.

JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:

Standard Edition Java Platform
Enterprise Edition Java Platform
Micro Edition Java Platform
--------------------------------------------

4.why we go for java?

The advantages of Java are as follows:

Java is easy to learn.
Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.

Java is object-oriented.
This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.

Java is platform-independent.
One of the most significant advantages of Java is its ability to move easily from one computer system to another. 
The ability to run the same program on many different systems is crucial to World Wide Web software, and 
Java succeeds at this by being platform-independent at both the source and binary levels.

5.What is the latest version of JDK and which version you are using in your project?

The latest version of Java is Java 17 or JDK 17

6.What is the latest version of eclispe and which version you are using in your project?

4.21 (2021-09 release)

7.Difference between c++ and java?

8.Features of java?
9.What type of tool you are using in your project to execute java?
10.Difference between class,method,object?
11.Where object stores?
12.How to access one class method in to another package in different package?
13.What is encapsulation?
14.Coding standard to create project,class,method,package and object ?
15.What gives Java it's "write once and run anywhere" nature?
